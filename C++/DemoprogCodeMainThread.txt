
To integrate the Kongsberg Maritime datagram assembly code with a customer prepared application 
(as exemplified in the supplied CombineEMDatagrams program) two specific functional elements needs 
to be employed:

1. 
A KM provided asynchronous consumer mechanism must be added to the customer application. 
This will allow the customer application to receive and handle the fully assembled 
datagrams without affecting the reception and assembly of subsequent fragmented datagrams.   

2.
The customer application must use a KM provided asynchronous datagram queuing mechanism.
This will allow the customer application to dispatch all incoming datagram fragments 
to the assembly process without any significant delay thus decoupling the datagram receive and 
the assembly  activities.  

The implementation of both mechanisms are included in the C++ source files and presented in the video.
